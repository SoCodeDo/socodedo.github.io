                        Before applying to Ada, I worked for various local goverment offices, seasonal retail positions, as well as being a freelance writer and screenwriter. In college, I studied both mechanical engineering and writing, in hopes of becoming a techincal writer. After leaving university, I found I lacked the passion for techincal writing, and started exploring a subject that was never presented to me as a career option: programming.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A year ago, I would spend my evenings after work, huddled in the corner of my local coffee shop, teaching myself how to program. Self-learning isn’t easy. It takes a lot of grit and even more self-accountability. But now, having a goal to join the tech industry, I was focused. I knew what I had to accomplish. I created deadlines, exams, and even homework. I became frustrated when code wouldn’t run, and even more excited when I fixed that same bug. I hadn't heard of Ada yet, and barley could grasp what my terminal did, but I was passionate and determined to teach myself a new skill that could maybe, hopefully, become a career.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up with an immigrant father who was also active-duty military, gave me the incredible gift of seeing others around the world through a lens that cultivated the importance of kindness and inclusivity. So naturally, when a friend introduced me to Ada last winter, it felt like a natural next step in my journey.

                        I am so grateful to be a member of Cohort 14, and even more excited to begin internship as a Software Developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my furry friends, enjoying the beautiful Pacific Northwest, and watching movies. Fun Fact: I'm left handed!
